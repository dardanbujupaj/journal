You can change the amount of listed entries with the `-n` flag.
`journal -n 2 l` lists the two latest entries.

With the `-a` flag you can list all available entries.

== Database

If no db-file is present a new one will be created.

WARNING: If the `~/.journal.db` file is deleted, all your journal entries are gone.
